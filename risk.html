        <div class="content">
            <p>There is no such thing as taking a risk.</p>
            <p>Well at least for a rational person. No one ever takes an action they genuinely believe has negative expected value. We are all expected value maximizers. What appears "risky" to an outsider is obvious to the person doing it.</p>
            <p>We act according to the world we believe in, not the one we're actually in. In practice, though, it is often impossible to calculate the probability distribution of future outcomes, the objective risk. Hence we create a representation of that distribution internally, our subjective risk. What we call "risk taking" is just the mismatch between these two. I like to define calibration here as the degree to which someone's subjective risk matches the objective risk.</p>
            <p>The most ambitious and extraordinary people I have interacted with, are the ones that consistently make calibrated decisions. I talked to Tarek Mansour a couple months ago. He fought for 18 months to get the main federal licensing process for Kalshi. The idea was literally illegal in the US when they got into YC. But what he and Luana had was a prior that most people didn't : that prediction markets could indeed be viewed as financial derivatives, not gambling. A prior that was built on his job as a macro trader.</p>
            <p>But how do you measure calibration if you can't measure objective risk? I think there are two main proxies.</p>
            <p>1) Track record of making hard decisions they can defend from first principles. Making hard decisions is uncomfortable and logically doesn't make sense unless there is a huge upside and understanding of that upside. Kalshi attacked their biggest obstacle first, compliance. Our decisions in our lifetime tend to regress towards the mean. As it turns out, making something noble is hard. If you are well calibrated, you see the upside, shape your decisions towards building something big and actively seek discomfort. In a way, this is an indirect evidence of calibration as big things are often hard to build. There is a conceptual gap though. Discomfort alone isn't evidence of calibration. In fact, San Francisco is a graveyard of founders who lived off of ramen and never made it. Hard decisions for the right reasons are easy to explain, the ones for wrong reasons are not.</p>
            <p>2) They often start with an open mind about pivots. Cursor started as a CAD-AI project. Airbnb started by renting air mattresses. Almost every conversation I had with my smart friends and founders surfaced this uncertainty. Ideas are not set, they are refined and updated in a Bayesian fashion with new information. Calibrated people actively seek disconfirming evidence and are able to precisely articulate what they don't know. A big red flag is people mapping out exactly how the future is going to pan out.</p>
            <p>There is a feedback loop with calibration too. People with more agency make more decisions actively. More decisions creates more contact with reality. This creates higher calibration.</p>
            <p>The closest filter I have found for outlier talent is people whose decisions stop looking daring once you understand their model.</p>
